# Multi-Agent System Benchmark Report

## Overview

This benchmark simulates a multi-agent system where agents with different roles (planner, coordinator, worker) 
collaborate to complete tasks. Each agent has its own memory system, allowing it to retain and retrieve 
information. The benchmark tests how well different memory systems (Neuroca and Agno) support multi-agent collaboration.

## Benchmark Parameters

- Number of agents: 7
- Simulation time: 20.0 seconds
- Task count: 25

## Analysis

### Task Completion

Both memory systems achieved similar task completion rates, suggesting that 
for this type of multi-agent coordination, the choice of memory system 
does not significantly impact the ability of agents to complete tasks.

### Task Processing Efficiency

Both memory systems supported similar task processing times, indicating 
comparable efficiency in retrieving task-related information from memory.

### Agent Communication

Agno's memory system demonstrated faster message processing, potentially 
offering advantages in scenarios requiring rapid agent communication.

### Resource Efficiency

Both memory systems exhibited similar memory usage, suggesting comparable 
efficiency in storing and managing agent knowledge and communication history.

## Conclusion

Both memory systems performed comparably across most metrics in this multi-agent 
benchmark. The choice between Neuroca and Agno for multi-agent systems may depend 
more on specific application requirements or integration considerations rather 
than raw performance differences.
